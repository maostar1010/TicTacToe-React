# TicTacToe-React
This project was created following the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#detecting-changes) in order to demonstrate version control on Github.

### In order to deploy the game on your local explorer, please follow the instructions below:
* *This set of instructions assumes that a recent version of Node.js is installed on your local environment.*

1. Create a new project by running the following code:
```
